## What's Canvas SDK

Canvas SDK is a JavaScript library that contains everything developers need to create new widgets.

Widgets are Miro entities, similar to stickies and images. They can be interactive, animated, and use high-fidelity graphics.

New widgets can be developed without modifying the Miro codebase. This allows to rapidly expand Miro capabilities and eventually, also open up Widget development to third parties.
