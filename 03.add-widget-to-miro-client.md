In this guide, you will learn how to add your new widget to the Miro client.

To transfer a widget from the playground to the Miro client, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the widget in the playground**
   - Ensure the widget is compiled in the playground environment.

2. **Deploy the compiled widget:**
   - Copy the compiled `.widget` file from the playground to the Miro client.

## Compile the widget

To compile the new widget, refer to the [Build a New Widget](02.build-new-widget.md#compile-the-widget) guide for more information.

## Deploy your widget to Miro Client

To deploy your widget to the Miro client, follow these steps:

1. From the playground, copy the `newwidget.widget` file from the `src/Frontend/WidgetClient/public/widgets` directory.
1. In the Miro client, paste the `newwidget.widget` file into the `client/packages/widget-surface/src/assets/widgets` directory.
1. Add the import statement in the `SurfaceWidgetInit.ts` file in the `packages/widget-surface/src` directory.

    ```ts
    import newwidgetWidget from './assets/widgets/newwidget.widget'
    ```

1. Add the widget to the `WIDGET_TYPES` enum to set its ID. This ID is required for the `cmd.surfaceWidget` command.

    ```ts
    'com.miro.newwidget': newwidgetWidget
    ```

1. In your browser, open the developer console and run the follwing command:

    ```javascript
    cmd.surfaceWidget('com.miro.newwidget')
    ```

### Additional information

While it is possible to use the playground for initial development, it is not mandatory. Widgets can be developed and deployed entirely within the Miro client.

By following these steps, you can effectively develop and deploy widgets in the Miro environment, whether you choose to start in the playground or work directly in the client.
