In this guide, you will learn how to set up the environment to run the Canvas SDK playground.

## Before you begin

1. Make sure you've [set up VPN](https://miro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/1954349066/Cloud+VPN+Prisma+Access+-+Connection+Steps).
2. Clone the Canvas SDK repository to your machine. This monorepo contains various project published as NPM packages.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:miroapp-dev/surface.git
    ```

## Setting up the environment

Make sure you have installed:

1. [Brew](#brew)
2. [Xcode](#xcode)
3. [Python 3](#python)
4. [NPM](#npm)
5. [Bazel](#bazel)

### Brew

Install [Brew](https://brew.sh/).

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Xcode

Install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) version 12 or higher from the App Store.

Once installed, check the version of Xcode:

```bash
/usr/bin/xcodebuild -version
```

The result should look similar to this:

```bash
Xcode 15.4
Build version 15F31d
```

Check that `xcode-select` is configured to use `xcodebuild`, not command line tools. Run the following command:

```bash
xcode-select -p
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
``` 

If you get some other response, run:

```bash
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

Then run the `xcode-select -p` command again to verify the change.

### NPM

Your NPM credentials must be set up correctly. Run the following command to check your credentials:

```bash
npm whoami
```

The result should print you username.

**⚠️ Important**: If you get a different response or an error, follow the steps to [configure private registry credentials](https://github.com/miroapp-dev/client/blob/master/documentation-portal/docs/setup.md#configure-private-registry-credentials).

### Python 3

Install the latest stable version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) on your machine. After the installation, run the following command to check the version of Python 3:

```bash
python3 --version
```

The result should look similar to this:

```bash
Python 3.9.7
```

### Bazel

Everything is built using [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) — a tool used for the automation of building. We use Bazelisk — a wrapper for Bazel, which automatically picks the right version of Bazel with respect to your current working directory and downloads it from the official server.

To install Bazelisk, use one of the following methods:

1. With [brew](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.29.1/install-os-x.html#step-2-install-the-bazel-homebrew-package): `brew install bazelisk`
2. With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bazel/bazelisk): `npm install -g @bazel/bazelisk`

## Running the playground

Canvas SDK has a standalone playground to explore the rendering engine and SurfaceWidgetSDK.

To run the playground:

1. From the `/surface` folder, run the following command to start the playground:

    ```bash
    bazel run //:WidgetClient
    ```

    This command may take a while when you run it for the first time. It will build the project and start a local server.

1. Open the browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). You should see the playground with a few widgets.

## Troubleshooting

### SSH keys

If you run into permission issues, you may need to run the following command to add your SSH private keys to both the **ssh-agent** and the macOS keychain:

```bash
ssh-add -K
```
